# LinkExtractor

A web app which strips the privided html text and extracts `<a>` tags and extracts its `href` values in a list, from where you can copy all of it.

I created it for personal use case.

Created with [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Deployed in [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
